Functional Project demoed
- board stays at top, but is updated with each player's turn
	-with updates, victory is checked

2 players - turns alternate -- BUT only 9 turns available
	-- could create counter for all 9, or evens/odds?
	-- player 1 = odds
	-- player 2 = evens
board is updated at each turn

game will continue until a victory is reached
	--- array within an array?
	--- check patterns if three in a row and X or O then that player wins
